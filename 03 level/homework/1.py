# Task 4: 
print( 5 + 3)       # Addition
print( 8 - 2)    # Subtraction
print( 4 * 6) # Multiplication
print( 10 / 2)      # Division

# Task 5: 
# When combining text data, Python concatenates the strings, joining them together.

text1 = "Hello, "
text2 = "world!"
print(text1 + text2)  # This will print "Hello, world!"

# Task 7:
# Creating a Python script to demonstrate various tasks
# Task 4: Printing results of different arithmetic operations
# Task 5: Combining two text data and printing the result
# Task 6: Introducing a syntax error to observe how Python handles it

# Task 8:
variable1 = 10
variable2 = 5
print("Arithmetic operation:", variable1 * variable2)  # Multiplication of the two variables

# Task 9: Explaining string and integer
# String: A data type used to represent text, enclosed within single ('') or double ("") quotes.
# Integer: A data type used to represent whole numbers without any decimal points.
# In Python, strings are used for textual data, while integers are used for numerical calculations.
